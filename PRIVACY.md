# Privacy Policy for VW-nopass-client

VW-nopass-client is a fork of the open-source Bitwarden browser extension.  
It provides secure credential autofill without exposing passwords in the user interface.

## Data Collection
The extension does not collect, log, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information with the developer.

## Data Processing
All encryption and decryption of vault data happens locally in the browser.  
The extension only communicates with the configured Bitwarden-compatible server to sync encrypted vault data.  
The developer does not operate or control your vault server.

## Permissions
The extension requests browser permissions strictly necessary for secure autofill and vault management.  
These are used exclusively for their intended purpose, as documented in the Chrome Web Store listing.

## Third Parties
The extension does not sell, share, or transmit data to any third-party service, outside of the vault server configured by the user.
